My name is Muhammad Hassnain. Graduated with a BSCS degree in 2020. Joined MTBC as Junior Data Scientist and quickly realised my strength is Software Engineering. I have developed 2 products for MTBC(Care cloud) from scratch. Because all the other team members were working as Data Scientists, I was the only developer.

After 1 year, joined Telenor Global Shared Services through Systems Limited as Integration Developer. As a result of completing the first phase of the project at TGSS awarded the Star of the Quarter and led the project development for 2nd phase of development.

In the middle of May and June, I became the product owner of the HR Integration, which consists of more than 20 systems. And it is the core of the Integration of All Telenor Business Units. Until now, I and my team have added 2 more systems to the integration and made some improvements in the existing integrations, which resulted in cost reduction, better performance and monitoring.
